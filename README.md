## Setup

1. Navigate in your terminal to where you want the code to be located and run:
>`git clone https://github.com/dbedggood/typescript-playground`

2. Navigate into the cloned folder and install the node modules with:
>`npm install`


## Running your code

1. Start the typescript compiler in watch mode *(WIP solution)*:
>`tsc --watch`

2. Then run the code compiled from `index.ts` in a new terminal with:
>`npm run dev`


## Testing your code

1. Run any tests found in the `src` folder with:
>`npm run test`
